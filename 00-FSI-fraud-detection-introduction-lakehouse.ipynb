    "## What is The Databricks Data Intelligence Platform for Banking?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the only enterprise data platform that allows you to leverage all your data, from any source, on any workload to optimize your business with real time data, at the lowest cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lakehouse allow you to centralize all your data, from customer & retail banking data to real time fraud detection, providing operational speed and efficiency at a scale never before possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple\n",
    "  One single platform and governance/security layer for your data warehousing and AI to **accelerate innovation** and **reduce risks**. No need to stitch together multiple solutions with disparate governance and high complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open\n",
    "  Built on open source and open standards. You own your data and prevent vendor lock-in, with easy integration with external solution. Being open also lets you share your data with any external organization, regardless of their data stack/vendor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicloud\n",
    "  One consistent data platform across clouds. Process your data where your need.\n",

    "With this information, not only we'll be able to analyse existing past fraud and understand common patterns, but we'll also be able to rate financial transaction risk in realtime.\n",
